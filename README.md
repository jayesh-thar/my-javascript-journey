<h1 align="center">My JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀</h1>

> A comprehensive repository to track my progress while mastering JavaScript, from core fundamentals to advanced, real-world concepts.

This repository serves as a personal log of my journey through the JavaScript language. It contains all my practice code, exercises, and notes, organized by topic. My goal is not just to learn, but to build a solid foundation in programming principles and create a public portfolio of my progress.

---

### ✨ My Goals & Philosophy

My primary objective is to gain a deep, foundational understanding of JavaScript. I am focusing on:
* **Core Concepts:** Truly understanding the "why" behind concepts like scope, closures, prototypes, and the event loop.
* **Clean Code:** Writing code that is readable, maintainable, and follows best practices.
* **Problem-Solving:** Developing the skills to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

---

### 💻 Tech Stack & Tools

* **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
* **Runtime:** Node.js (for running scripts)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
* **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code

### 📚 Table of Contents

Below is the structure of the repository. Each link will take you to the corresponding section with the relevant code and notes.

* 📂 **[01-basics](./01_basics/)**: Covers the absolute fundamentals, including variables (`let`, `const`, `var`), primitive data types, type conversion, operators, strings, numbers, and dates.

* 📂 **[02-arrays-and-objects](./02-arrays-and-objects/)**: A deep dive into JavaScript's core data structures. Includes creating and manipulating arrays, all major array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`), and working with objects.

* 📂 **[03-control-flow](./03-control-flow/)**: Explores the logic and decision-making backbone of programming with conditional statements like `if/else`, `switch`, and understanding truthy/falsy values.

* 📂 **[04-iteration](./04-iteration/)**: Focuses on loops for executing code repeatedly. Covers `for` loops, `while` loops, `do-while`, and modern iterators for arrays and objects like `for...of`.

* 📂 **[05-functions](./05-functions/)**: A comprehensive look at functions, the building blocks of programs. Includes scopes (global, block, function), parameters, the `this` keyword, arrow functions, and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE).

* 📂 **[06-dom-manipulation](./06-dom-manipulation/)**: Focuses on interacting with web pages using the Document Object Model (DOM). Covers selecting elements, changing content and styles, and creating/deleting new elements dynamically.

* 📂 **[07-events](./07-events/)**: Covers handling user interactions and making web pages interactive. Includes event listeners, the event object, event propagation (bubbling and capturing), and common events like `click`, `mouseover`, and `keydown`.

* 📂 **[08-asynchronous-js](./08-asynchronous-js/)**: Tackles the core concepts of asynchronous programming. Covers the event loop, `setTimeout`, Promises (`.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`), modern `async/await` syntax, and making API requests with `fetch`.

* 📂 **[09-object-oriented-programming](./09-object-oriented-programming/)**: Explains OOP concepts in JavaScript. Covers prototypes, prototypal inheritance, constructor functions, ES6 Classes, getters & setters, and static properties.

* 📂 **[10-advanced-concepts](./10-advanced-concepts/)**: Includes powerful but advanced topics like Closures (for data privacy and encapsulation) and the essential function methods: `call`, `bind`, and `apply`.
